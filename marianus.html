<H1>Codex Marianus</H1>

<P><A HREF="MAR.TXT">TEXT FILE</A></P>

<P> The e-text should be considered to be a tertiary source as it is not based on the manuscript itself, but on Vatroslav Jagi&#263;'s edition thereof. The file is not meant to be completely self-explanatory: it must be used with the edition.</P>

<P> The lines in the files do not correspond to the manuscript lines, being arranged according to Gospel chapters and verses. Each line begins with a seven-digit number which is to be interpreted as follows:

<UL>

<LI> first digit: Gospel (1=Matthew, 2=Mark, 3=Luke, 4=John)</LI>

<LI> the following two digits: Gospel chapter</LI>

<LI> the following two digits: verse</LI>

<LI> the last but one digit: line number inside the verse (in the file, not in the codex: 0,1,2,...)</LI>

<LI> the last digit: always 0 (reserved for special uses)</LI>

</UL>

In the beginning of each Gospel (except for Matthew, the beginning of which is missing in the codex) there is a "00-chapter, 00-verse" section into which the pericope lists found in the codex are placed. In these passages the line division does correspond to that of the codex.</P>

<p> The transliteration used in the text only makes use of the 7-bit ASCII code so as to ensure maximal portability. Upper-case letters are used to represent different graphemes than the corresponding lower-case letters.</P>
